# DomainWall

This code simulates a domainwall in 1+1 dimensions.

The potential is quartic in principal, and can be deformed by a cubic term to yield a potential with two degenerate vacua or one true and one 'false' vacuum.

A Python script to visualise output is also provided. For instance, for a symmetric potential of the shape below, the domain wall behaves as expected.
The field in either degenerate vacuum stays there and is not permanently pulled over the domain wall.

When the potential is deformed so the vacua are no longer degenerate, the difference between vacua makes the wall moves towards the false vacuum.

The walls can be seen to 'rebound' a little.
